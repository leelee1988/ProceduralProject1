#ProceduralProject
I have been hired to create software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. 
Without the software, workers on the production floor are physically producing items and having to write down what is produced in a production log book. 
Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generate production reports. 
In addition to the ability to record production, the software also needs the ability to add to the product line (the catalog of products that are able to be produced).<br />

What is the project?<br />
Who made it? I made this project indepently but with some help of a classmate.<br />
I made this in the summer of 2019, for a Programming Methodology class where I was learning c++ for the first time.<br />
This class was made in class but was also worked on at home becasue this was an assignment.<br />
Note for school project: this may be the only thing someone visiting your page reads. Try to mae a great impresison. Make someone want to hire you. This section will also be useful to you in the future to remind you about the project. 

## Demonstration

Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Diagrams

Such as a class diagram. <br />
